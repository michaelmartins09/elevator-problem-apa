## üöÄ Technology

This project was development with:

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)





## üíª Project

To elaborate this work, an algorithm capable of solving the elevator problem will be developed and implemented. 
For this, a dynamic program  will be used as a project paradigm. For the purposes of experiments, 
it will be possible to use dynamic arguments as data input for the operation of the solution or alternative alternative 
to perform tests with standard data. With that it will be possible to analyze the functioning and performance of the algorithm 
in relation to the solution of the problem. Finally, an analytical evaluation will be carried out that results in graphs of the results 
obtained by this experiment, so that it is possible to draw up a comparison between the benefits of using dynamic programming for the program. 
solving the problem and finally identifying the complexity of the algorithm. To implement the solution of our solution used, we will use the programming 
language JavaScript. The choice of this language to solve the problem presented, the preference for the popularity of the language when it comes to dynamic 
program implementations. In addition, the authors of this article are familiar with the chosen language.
